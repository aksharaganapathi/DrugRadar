# DrugRadar

Takes input of over the counter and prescription drugs and checks the interactions, as well as any side effects that might occur
Using NLP and Respell we are able to take into account various search queries and results in order to provide the user 
with accurate and reasonably fast data on whether or not a drug is safe for usage

Future Add-Ons that are on the way: 
1. Utilize databases and image to text services, however the limits of respell and AWS limited out capabilities
2. Turn this into an app and give people notifications to take/ and warn when they take certain drugs
3. We also want to implement prescription upload and scheduling into the app.
