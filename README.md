**Inspiration:**
The health and wellbeing of our loved ones is paramount, and this became particularly clear to me when I witnessed my grandparents taking multiple medications every day. In addition to their regular prescriptions, they often needed to purchase additional over-the-counter medicines to manage pain, but the potential for drug interactions and side effects made me concerned about their safety. This led me to develop a solution to this problem and create a tool that could help people manage their medications safely.

**What it does:**
Our application utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and respell technology to take input from both over-the-counter and prescription drugs and check for potential interactions and side effects. By providing users with accurate and timely information about the safety of their medication regimen, we are empowering them to make informed decisions about their health.

**How we built it:**
Developing this application was a challenging process, but our team was able to overcome obstacles by leveraging the latest technologies. We used NLP to process a wide range of queries and respell technology to ensure accurate search results. While we initially planned to incorporate databases and image-to-text services, we faced some limitations due to the technology and AWS. However, we were able to adapt and still develop a reliable solution for our users.

**Difficulties we faced:**
One of the main challenges we faced while building this application was incorporating databases and image-to-text services. However, we were able to find alternative solutions and still develop a reliable tool for our users. Another challenge was ensuring that the application could process a wide range of queries and return accurate results quickly. We were able to overcome this challenge by leveraging NLP and respell technology.

**Future Steps:**
As we continue to build on this concept, we are eager to take the next step and transform our application into a user-friendly mobile app. By creating an app, we can give users the ability to receive notifications and warnings when they take certain drugs. This feature will help people stay on top of their medication regimen and avoid potential health risks. Additionally, we aim to incorporate prescription upload and scheduling functionality, making medication management even more convenient. Ultimately, our goal is to provide people with a tool that makes managing their health easier and safer.
